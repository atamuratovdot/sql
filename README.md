Write a select statement that returns the names of people (based on an internal query in the `SELECT` clause) who placed orders for the menu with identifiers 13, 14, and 18, and the date of the orders should be January 7, 2022. Be careful with "Denied Section" before your work.

Please take a look at the pattern of internal query.

    SELECT 
	    (SELECT ... ) AS NAME  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
    FROM ...
    WHERE ...

Use the SQL construction from Exercise 05 and add a new calculated column (use column name ‘check_name’) with a check statement a pseudocode for this check is given below) in the `SELECT` clause.

    if (person_name == 'Denis') then return true

Let's apply data intervals to the `person` table. 
Please make an SQL statement that returns the identifiers of a person, the person's names, and the interval of the person's ages (set a name of a new calculated column as 'interval_info') based on the pseudo code below.

    if (age >= 10 and age <= 20) then return 'interval #1'
    else if (age > 20 and age < 24) then return 'interval #2'
    else return 'interval #3'

And yes... please sort a result by ‘interval_info’ column in ascending mode.

Please make a select statement that returns person names and pizzeria names based on the `person_visits` table with a visit date in a period from January 07 to January 09, 2022 (including all days) (based on an internal query in the `FROM' clause).


Please take a look at the pattern of the final query.

    SELECT (...) AS person_name ,  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
            (...) AS pizzeria_name  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
    FROM (SELECT … FROM person_visits WHERE …) AS pv -- this is an internal query in a main FROM clause
    ORDER BY ...

Please add a ordering clause by person name in ascending mode and by pizzeria name in descending mode.
